# Thermodynamics_models

# Objective
This repository aims to explore diverse problems within chemical engineering and how to solve them 
using mathematical modeling and numerical simulation. 

# Contents
- (Ex1) How to calculate state properties of a real fluid using departure functions.
- (Ex2) Efficiency comparison between a throttling valve vs a turbine/nozzle for reducing gas temperature.
- (Ex3) Valid temperature and pressure conditions to assume ideal gas behavior modeling (example: CCLF3 refrigerant)
